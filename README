Find Many Strings
=================

"Find Many Strings" is an extension for the Chromium (and Chrome) browser. It tries to highlight the word(s) searched for in a webpage. Searching a new string will not remove the highlights done for the previously searched string(s).

The extension is open-sourced and licensed under the MIT License. So you can use the extensions without feeling paranoid :-)

The icon for this extension is the Tamil word "தேடு" which means "Search". I used the awesome Gimp project to create this icon.

The extension only highlights the search strings and does not allow you to navigate to previous/next matches. It may be easy to add but I have not found an usecase for this. Patches are welcome for this if you find it useful or want to practice Javascript. Also, it may make the UI complex.
